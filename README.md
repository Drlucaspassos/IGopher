4. Launch it:
- On Windows, open a **Windows Terminal** in the folder (or powershell/cmd but the experience quality can be lower) and execute it: ```./tui.exe``` or just drag and drop tui.exe in your command prompt
- On Linux, open you favorite shell in the folder and execute it: ```./tui```
5. Configure the bot with your Instagram credentials and set your desired scrapping and autodm settings. To do that, you can use the TUI settings screen or directly edit the config.yaml file.

### Flags

IGopher have a flags system for debuging or to enable system feature.
You can activate them by adding them after the executable call, for exemple to activate headless mode:
```./tui --headless```

There is the list of all available flags:
```
--debug
      Display debug and selenium output
--force-download
      Force redownload of all dependencies even if exists
--headless
      Run WebDriver with frame buffer
--ignore-dependencies
      Skip dependencies management
--loglevel string
      Log level threshold (default "info")
--port int
      Specify custom communication port (default 8080)
```

You can recover this list by adding **--help** flag.
